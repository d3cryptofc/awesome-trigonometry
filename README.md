## Introduction
Maybe like me before, you know how to program but you don't know how to use trigonometric functions.

Therefore, this repository is focused on illustrating with animations, and if this is not possible,
just showing the code may be enough to understand the concepts.

Otherwise, if you have any questions, don't forget to open an issue.

**Enjoy and have good studies!**
