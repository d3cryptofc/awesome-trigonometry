## Introduction
Maybe like me before, you know how to program but you don't know how to use trigonometric functions.

Therefore, this repository is focused on illustrating with animations, and if this is not possible,
just showing the code may be enough to understand the concepts.

Otherwise, if you have any questions, don't forget to open an issue.

**Enjoy and have good studies!**


## Run all drawings in one time
It's your first time here? You might want to look at all available drawings:

```
python3 all.py
```

## Drawings

### Pythagorean Theorem

Pythagorean theorem illustrated.

1. Draw axes cross.
2. Draw a right-angled triangle of random size.
3. Draw the square of all sides of the triangle.

```
python3 pythagorean_theorem.py
```

### Colorful Filled Circle

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://i.imgur.com/VqmoQXr.gif">

Drawing a circle and filling it with colorful segments.

1. Draw the cross of the axes.
2. Draw the circumference of the circle.
3. Draw colored segments inside the circle, resulting in a colored fill.

```
python3 colorful_filled_circle.py
```
